    "# Greedy Learner - Step 2\n",
    "Step 2: Optimization algorithm. Formally state the optimization problem where the objective function is the maximization of the cumulative expected margin over all the products. Design a greedy algorithm to optimize the objective function when all the parameters are known. The algorithm works as follows. At the beginning, every item is associated with the corresponding lowest price. Then, evaluate the marginal increase obtained when the price of a single product is increased by a single level, thus considering 5 potential different price configurations at every iteration, and choose the price configuration providing the best marginal increase (a price configuration specifies the price of every product). The algorithm stops when no new configuration among the 5 evaluated is better than the previous one. For instance, at the beginning, evaluate the 5 price configurations in which all the products are priced with the lowest price except for one product which is priced with the second lowest price. If all these price configurations are worse than the configuration in which all the products are priced with the lowest price, stop the algorithm and return the configuration with the lowest price for all the products. Otherwise, choose the best price configuration and re-iterate the algorithm. Notice that the algorithm monotonically increases the prices as well as the cumulative expected margin. Therefore, the algorithms cannot cycle. However, there is not guarantee that the algorithm will return the optimal price configuration. Develop the algorithm by Python.\n"
